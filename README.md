# Canon Lore 2.0

This is a project with three parts:

* The Canon Lore 2.0 database (/db), containing the scripts to create a new database and fill it with the data from a copy of the old one.
* The Canon Lore Wordpress Plugin (/wordpress), a work-in-progress reimplementation of Canon Lore as a plugin for use on the Lochac website.
* The Canon Lore API (/api), a REST API allowing other software to query the database for useful data

If you don't already know what Canon Lore is, you're probably going to be a bit confused by all this.  Ah well.
